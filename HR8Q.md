###What does privacy mean to you?
It's an essential part of sound money.

###Why is privacy important to your project team? 
because it's essential.

###What makes your project stand out above other projects?
We are a cypherpunk, stakeholder directed organisation.

We can make decentralised decisions about change with an established process that prevents the community from splitting by showing unequivocally how many stakeholders want what

###What is the path to mass adoption of your project?

Since every stakeholder has the opportunity to vote about change in a 'swift' process that has undisputable results, we will be able to adapt more quickly then other decentralised projects. This engaged process, combined with our cypherpunk roots and our guiding constitution assures that we will pull ever further ahead of the competition and evolve further into the permissionless, censorhip-resistant, peer-to-peer money that the worlds desperately needs.
